### Team Structure

#### Development Teams
Launch Pad primarily consists of agile development teams centered around a shared project.
Each team consists of a Tech Lead and a number of Developers, usually between 5 to 8. 

Tech Leads are experienced developers who are responsible for managing the team by planning the project roadmap, assigning tickets during sprints, and implementing challenging features.
They are also available as a resource to less experienced developers on the team.
If you have any trouble with your issue, questions about Launch Pad, or just a random technical question: ask your Tech Lead.

Teams focus on a particular platform or technology, like Android, Web, or Machine Learning, and build a project for that platform.
Platform teams are meant to balance learning with creation:
teams working together have the ability to build interesting projects,
less experienced developers have the opportunity to learn in the process,
and more experienced developers get a taste of management and mentoring.
Teams aim to model the experience of building a product at a software company.

#### Design Team
UBC Launch Pad has a design team that creates designs for all of our apps.
If your app has a user interface, you should be talking to the design team.
Instructions for creating tickets for designers is in the [Design repo](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/design).

#### Business Team
UBC Launch Pad has a business team that focusses on strategically growing the team.
This team will focus on increasing campus awareness, forming strategic partnerships, and acquiring talent in order to further contribute to Launch Pad's vision to be the leading university technology club in Vancouver, Canada, or maybe even the world.

### Meetings
Launch Pad meets every Saturday from 11AM-3PM.
You are expected to be on time for every meeting.
If you can't make a meeting or will be significantly late, let your team lead know as far in advance as possible.
The first hour is reserved for each team to catch up on last week's progress and plan tickets for the next week.
At 12PM, we have a Launch Pad-wide stand-up where a member from each team tells everyone (1) what their team has accomplished since last week and (2) what their team plans to work on this week.
After the Launch Pad-wide stand-up, each team works on their project together until 3PM.

Each meeting a different team will give a brief live demo of their project just after standup, showing off any new features that have been developed since their previous demo.

### Tickets
As a team member, you are assigned one or more tickets every week.
The total expected time to complete your tickets for a week should be about 8 hours (4 hours in the meeting and 4 hours during the week).
You are expected to complete your tickets and create a pull request _before_ the next meeting. 

### Absence & Neglected Tickets
If you can't make a meeting or complete a ticket because you're sick, swamped at school, traveling, etc,
let your Tech Lead and team know as far in advance as possible--everyone understands that life gets in the way sometimes.
If you continually miss meetings, neglect tickets, or don't communicate with your team, we will ask you to leave Launch Pad.
