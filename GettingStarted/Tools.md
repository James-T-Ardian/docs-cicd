## Tools & Technologies

We use a variety of tools at Launch Pad for development and communication.

### Slack
We use Slack for team-wide communication, announcements, and project-specific coordination.
Since we are on the free tier of Slack, where messages eventually expire, anything important or permanent should be in a GitHub issue, version-controlled document, or wiki page.
Our Slack can be found [here](https://ubclaunchpad.slack.com); sign up now if you haven't!
You should install Slack on your laptop and phone, turn on @mention notifications, and respond to messages promptly.

### GitHub
We use GitHub to host, document, and manage the code in all our projects.
Launch Pad-wide documentation is hosted in this repository--if you're not sure about something, this is the first place to check.
Each project has an associated GitHub repository,
and documentation for the project lives in that repository, either as version-controlled files (preferably in Markdown format like these) or in the wiki.

### ZenHub
[ZenHub](https://www.zenhub.com/) is an addition to GitHub that adds more advanced project management tools.
We use ZenHub for tracking issues within projects, assigning issues to members, and viewing project progress.
You should install the ZenHub Chrome or Firefox extension and get acquainted with its features if you aren't already.

### Rocket
[Rocket](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/rocket) is our very own Slack bot, used for managing our roster across Slack, GitHub, and our website.
You can get started by typing `@rocket help` into a private Slack chat with @rocket.
The name and position you provide, along with your Slack profile picture, will automatically show up on our website (once you've been added to a team).
Providing your GitHub username allows Rocket to add you to the correct GitHub teams and repositories.
