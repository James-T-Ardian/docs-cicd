# ðŸ“¦ Repository Management

## README
The primary source of truth for any repository should be the README.

At the top of the README, you should provide a summary of your software, and in particular briefly and succinctly outline what role your tool plays or what problem it solves.

Installation instructions should come immediately after this summary.
Your installation instructions should be written in as simple and clear a manner as possible
and any differences in installation between different operating systems or environments should be made clear.
It is also usually helpful to include separate development setup instructions,
especially if this involves any extra dependencies or tools.

Optionally, you may want to include sections below this that explain the high-level operation of the tool, list any major dependencies, and/or credit your hard-working developers and designers.

Many continuous integration, code coverage, and documentation sites provide ''badges'' of project status that you can place at the top of your README.
These are highly recommended--they make your README look much more professional.

For a fantastic example of a README page, check out Launch Pad's [Inertia](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/inertia) project.

## LICENSE
Your repository should contain a license that makes it clear to users what they can and cannot do with your software.
Launch Pad recommends the permissive [MIT license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License).

## Enforcing Standards
You should enforce a clearly defined set of standards for your code;
in particular, this should both be listed in your documentation and enforced during the build process.

Most modern programming languages have linters or other static analysis tools to catch ''obvious'' mistakes and enforce code style and documentation rules,
and running these alongside your tests is highly recommended.
Additionally, many languages, including Python and golang, have standardized code styles and tools to enforce them, such as pycodestyle and gofmt.

Adding a pull request template will increase the likelihood that pull request descriptions contain the information you and other maintainers need during the review process.

Include a .gitignore file to reduce the chances that people push unwanted content;
in particular, it is highly recommended to include config files produced by common IDEs, like IntelliJ, Xcode, Android Studio, and so on.

It is highly recommended that you provide Docker and docker-compose files as a means of ensuring simple setup and standardized development/build environments.

## Builds and Tests
You must have a continuous integration system in place that ensures that any new code is tested and meets your coding standards.
Failing to enforce standards through the build process will place that burden squarely on you and your fellow contributors during the code review process.
Enforcing a test code coverage threshold that your tool should be at or above at all times can be an effective way to ensure that your code is well tested, but it will by no means guarantee it.
Ideally documentation about the inner workings of the tool should lie as close to the code it describes as possible.
