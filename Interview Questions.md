## Whiteboard Coding Questions

### Generic Questions To Ask
* How would you test this function? Provide example test cases/edge cases?

### Beginner
* Fizzbuzz: Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”

### Intermediate
* Given an ordered array of integers, which may contain any integer in the range [0,99], write a method that prints out the integers not included in the array. For example, given the array [5, 95], the method should output the following three strings "0-4", "6-94", "96-99".
* Output for [3,5] should be "4", not "4-4"
* Does the method throw an out of bounds exception when it reaches the end of the array (are the indices correct?)
