# Slack

* [Cool Channels](#cool-channels)
* [Bots & Apps](#bots--apps)
  * [Rocket](#rocket)
  * [Pull Reminders](#pull-reminders)

We use Slack for team-wide communication, announcements, and project-specific
coordination. Since we are on the free tier of Slack, messages eventually
expire, so anything important or permanent should be in a GitHub issue,
version-controlled document, or wiki page.

Our Slack can be found [here](https://ubclaunchpad.slack.com); sign up now if
you haven't!

You should also install Slack on your laptop and phone, turn on @mention
notifications, and respond to messages promptly. Slack has apps available for
all major platforms.

## Bots & Apps

### Rocket

[Rocket](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/rocket) is our very own Slack bot, used
for managing our roster across Slack, GitHub, and our website.

You can get started by typing `@rocket help` into a private Slack chat with
@rocket. Please don't do this in a public channel like #general, as everyone
will be able to see your interactions with Rocket.

The name and position you provide, along with your Slack profile picture, will
automatically show up on our website (once you've been added to a team).
Providing your GitHub username allows Rocket to add you to the correct GitHub
teams and repositories.

Note that we're currently working on revamping this tool - check out
[Rocket 2](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/rocket2) to learn more!

### Pull Reminders

[Pull Reminders](https://pullreminders.com/) is an awesome way to stay up to date
on your team's project through notifications and pull request review reminders
delivered straight to your Slack account. The website also features some slick
graphs and leaderboards to help visualize your hard work and compare against
your peers.

You can configure Pull Reminders for your account through the website of the
Slack bot - just shoot `@Pull Reminders` a message in the Launch Pad Slack
workspace!
