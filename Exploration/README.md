## Operating Systems

* [Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/)
  is a free online textbook that introduces basic operating system concepts like
  processes, virtual memory, and file systems in an accessible, highly-readable way.

## Programming Languages

* [Crafting Interpreters](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com)
  is a (sadly unfinished) book-length tutorial on buildling your own interpreter,
  from the ground up (including every single line of code!). The
  [Durian](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/durian) made a lot of use of it!

## Machine Learning

* [Neural Networks and Machine Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com)
  is an overview of (deep) neural networks, one of the most popular techniques
  for machine learning. It's written by Michael Nielsen, also known for one
  of the standard quantum computing textbooks.
